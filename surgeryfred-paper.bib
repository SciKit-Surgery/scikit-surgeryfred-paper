abstract = {Image-guidance systems based on fiducial registration typically display some measure of registration accuracy based on
the goodness of fit of the fiducials. A common measure is fiducial registration error (FRE), which equals the root-meansquare
error in fiducial alignment between image space and physical space. It is natural for the surgeon to regard the
displayed estimate of error as an indication of the accuracy of the system's ability to provide guidance to surgical targets
for a given case. Thus, when the estimate is smaller than usual, it may be assumed that the target registration error (TRE)
is likely to be smaller than usual. We show that this assumption, while intuitively convincing, is in fact wrong. We show
it in two ways. First, we prove to first order that for a given system with a given level of normally distributed fiducial
localization error, all measures of goodness of fit are statistically independent of TRE, and therefore FRE and TRE are
uncorrelated. Second, we demonstrate by means of computer simulations that they are uncorrelated for the exact
problem as well. Since TRE is the true measure of registration accuracy of importance to the success of the surgery, our
results show that no estimate of accuracy for a given patient that is based on goodness of fiducial fit for that patient gives
any information whatever about true registration accuracy for that patient. Therefore surgeons should stop using such
measures as indicators of registration quality for the patients on whom they are about to operate.},

For a neurosurgeon using the neuronavigation system, it is important to have a clear understanding of when an error may occur, what the magnitude of it is, and how to avoid it or reduce its influence on the final application accuracy. In this article, we classify all the errors into 2 groups according to the working principle of neuronavigation systems. The first group contains the errors caused by the differences between the anatomic structures in the images and that of the real patient, and the second group contains the errors occurring in transforming the position of surgical tools from the patient space to the image space. Each group is further divided into 2 subgroups. We discuss 16 types of errors and classify each of them into one of the subgroups. The classification and analysis of these errors should help neurosurgeons understand the power and limits of neuronavigation systems and use them more properly.}",

abstract = {Abstract Background Assessment of errors is essential in development, testing and clinical application of computer-assisted neurosurgery. Our aim was to provide a comprehensive overview of the different methods to assess target registration error (TRE) and target positioning error (TPE) and to develop a proposal for a standardized reporting of error assessment. Methods A PubMed research on phantom, cadaver or clinical studies on TRE and TPE has been perfomed. Reporting standards have been defined according to (a) study design and evaluation methods and (b) specifications of the navigation technology. Results The proposed standardized reporting includes (a) study design (controlled, non-controlled), study type (non-anthropomorphic phantom, anthropomorphic phantom, cadaver, patient), target design, error type and subtypes, space of TPE measurement, statistics, and (b) image modality, scan parameters, tracking technology, registration procedure and targeting technique. Conclusions Adoption of the proposed standardized reporting may help in the understanding and comparability of different accuracy reports. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

abstract="In image-guided neurosurgery, current commercial systems usually provide only rigid registration, partly because it is harder to predict, validate and understand non-rigid registration error. For instance, when surgeons see a discrepancy in aligned image features, they may not be able to distinguish between registration error and actual tissue deformation caused by tumor resection. In this case, the spatial distribution of registration error could help them make more informed decisions, e.g., ignoring the registration where the estimated error is high. However, error estimates are difficult to acquire. Probabilistic image registration (PIR) methods provide measures of registration uncertainty, which could be a surrogate for assessing the registration error. It is intuitive and believed by many clinicians that high uncertainty indicates a large error. However, the monotonic association between uncertainty and error has not been examined in image registration literature. In this pilot study, we attempt to address this fundamental problem by looking at one PIR method, the Gaussian process (GP) registration. We systematically investigate the relation between GP uncertainty and error based on clinical data and show empirically that there is a weak-to-moderate positive monotonic correlation between point-wise GP registration uncertainty and non-rigid registration error.",
