Understanding the relationship between residual errors (fiducial registration error) and target registration error is important for the correct use of interventional guidance systems. We present the SciKit-Surgery Fiducial Registration Educational Demonstrator and outline its use in educational and research contexts. SciKit-SurgeryFRED was developed to enable remote teaching of key concepts in image registration during 2020, but also supports research into user interface design for image registration systems. Preliminary results support the assumption that knowing the exact value of target registration error leads to better treatment. Display of other statistics had little impact on the treatment performance.
