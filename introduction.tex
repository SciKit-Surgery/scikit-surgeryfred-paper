\section{Introduction}
The fact that \gls{FRE} is uncorrelated with \gls{TRE} is well established 
\cite{fitzpatrick2009}. In spite of this, many students and users of clinical guidance systems struggle to 
correctly interpret \gls{FRE} and residual errors in general. 
SciKit-SurgeryFRED (Fiducial Registration Educational Demonstrator)
 \cite{stephen_thompson_2020_3946090} was developed using the 
SciKit-Surgery \cite{PMID:32436132} libraries to probe the causes of misconceptions 
about \gls{FRE} and \gls{TRE}. SciKit-SurgeryFRED was developed specifically to support on line learning during the enforced lockdowns of 2020, but also provides tools to enable research into user interface design for image guidance systems. SciKit-SurgeryFRED is open 
source software and we encourage researchers and educators to use and contribute to it. 

In this paper we introduce the SciKit-SurgeryFRED application and show how it
be used as an educational tool and as a more general purpose library for
simulation of registration for image guided interventions.

The tutorial utilises questioning strategies within the application, analysis, synthesis and evaluation levels of Bloom's taxonomy \cite{blooms_tax}.

If we change the error model to something non normal would we get correlation between FLE and TRE? Should try this and include.

Include something on non-isotropic errors.

Include something on systematic errors
