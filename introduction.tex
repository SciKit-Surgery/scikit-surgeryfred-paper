\section{Introduction}
The fact that \gls{FRE} is uncorrelated with \gls{TRE} is well established 
\cite{fitzpatrick2009}. In spite of this, there many students struggle to 
correctly interpret \gls{FRE} and residual errors in general, and there 
remain clinical guidance 
systems that report \gls{FRE}. 
To investigate why this is so and to attempt to rectify
 it, we have SciKit-SurgeryFRED (Fiducial Registration Educational Demonstrator)
 \cite{stephen_thompson_2020_3946090} using the 
SciKit-Surgery \cite{PMID:32436132} libraries.

In this paper we introduce the SciKit-SurgeryFRED application and show how it
be used as an educational tool and as a more general purpose library for
simulation of registration for image guided interventions.

The tutorial utilises questioning strategies within the application, analysis, synthesis and evaluation levels of Bloom's taxonomy \cite{blooms_tax}.

If we change the error model to something non normal would we get correlation between FLE and TRE? Should try this and include.

Include something on non-isotropic errors.

Include something on systematic errors
