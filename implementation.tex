The registration algorithms and statistical measures of {TRE} are imported from SciKit-SurgeryCore and are shared with clinical applications built on SciKit-Surgery. The user interface is implemented in HTML and JavaScript, using Chart.js\footnote{https://www.chartjs.org/} for plotting functionality.}
