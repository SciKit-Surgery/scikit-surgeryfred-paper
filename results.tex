\section{Results}
\subsection{\fred as a Teaching Aid}

\fred (v0.0.3)\cite{stephen_thompson_2020_3946090} was used at our Medical Summer School in 2020 with a cohort of 5 students. Feedback suggested that it had improved their understanding
of fiducial based registration. 

\subsection{\fred for Research in System Usability}
The results of the game based usability study are shown in Figure \ref{fig:usability}. As expected scores are 
highest when the actual \gls{TRE} is known. Interestingly it appears that when told only the expected value of the \gls{FLE} the students
tended to under treat the target more, resulting in lower overall scores. This study currently only has 100 data points (20 for each category)
so it must be stated that the results are not yet statistically significant.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Extension to Anisotropic Errors}
We simulated an anisotropic independent \gls{FLE}, with \gls{FLE} in the x 
direction being 3 times that in the y and z. Errors were scaled so that the 
expected absolute value of the \gls{FLE} was the same as for the isotropic case. 
\fred was then used to perform at least 200 simulated registrations, the results of
which are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:anis_error}.

	\end{center}
\end{figure}

It was apparent when preforming the registrations that the majority of target 
registration error was in the x direction. However this is not apparent in the 
statistics of Figure \ref{fig:anis_error}.
\subsection{Addition of Systematic Errors}
In this case the error is an isotropic uniform random variable, in the range
-0.5 to 0.5. This error will be applied to all fiducial markers for a 
given registration. The results of this modification are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:sys_error}.
