\section{Introduction}
The fact that \gls{FRE} is uncorrelated with \gls{TRE} is well established 
\cite{fitzpatrick2009}. In spite of this, there remain clinical guidance 
systems that report \gls{FRE} and it is reasonably common to see residual
errors reported as a measure of accuracy in papers discussing image
 registration. To investigate why this is so and to attempt to rectify
 it, we have SciKit-SurgeryFRED (Fiducial Registration Educational Demonstrator)
 \cite{stephen_thompson_2020_3908130} using the 
SciKit-Surgery \cite{PMID:32436132} libraries.

In this paper we introduce the SciKit-SurgeryFRED application and show how it
be used as an educational tool and as a more general purpose library for
simulation of registration for image guided interventions.
