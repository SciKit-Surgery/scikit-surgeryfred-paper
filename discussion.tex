\section{Discussion and Conclusion}
SciKit-SurgeryFRED has proven useful for the teaching of fiducial based registration. The results of the usability study 
are also of interest, however significantly more participants are needed before any firm conclusions can be drawn. This 
should be possible as a major strength of SciKit-SurgeryFRED is that it can be deployed anywhere. 

Future work will expand the range of \gls{FLE} models implemented, to include anisotropic \cite{4359072} 
errors and systematic errors \cite{6294449}. Similarly it might be interesting to implement surface based 
registration and graphical methods to communicate the likely registration error \cite{PMID:29663273}.




%Weaknesses:
%Useability study needs more samples, plus it should include a Null case (no information.

%Future work;
%We will include the FLE in the game log file, so we can examine what happens to performance under different conditions of FLE.

%Use FRED to examine other registration methods, for example a skin surface based method as used by medtronic.

%Use FRED to examine other ways of communicating registration error, for example raphical methods like (several, but include Thompson 2018)
